# Objective
The objective of the project is to develop digital logic circuits such as logic gates, adders, and multiplexers using Verilog within VLSI software. The designs will be simulated to validate their functionality, and simulation results will be analyzed using the waveform viewer in the VLSI software to ensure accurate operation.

 # Key activities

  1.Specification: Define circuit functionality and requirements.

  2.Verilog Design: Create Verilog modules for logic gates, adders, multiplexers, etc.

  3.Coding: Write Verilog code adhering to design specifications.

  4.Simulation Setup: Configure simulation environment in VLSI software.

  5.Simulation: Execute simulations to verify circuit functionality.

  6.Waveform Analysis: Analyze simulation results using waveform viewer.

  7.Debugging: Identify and fix errors in Verilog code or design.

  8.Verification: Ensure circuits meet specified requirements.

  9.Documentation: Document design, Verilog code, and simulation results.

# Technologies Used


  1.Verilog: Hardware description language for specifying digital circuits.

  2.VLSI Software: Tools such as Cadence Virtuoso, Synopsys Design Compiler, or Xilinx Vivado 
  for Verilog-based design and simulation.

  3.Simulation Tools: ModelSim, QuestaSim, or Xilinx ISim for simulating Verilog designs.

  4.Waveform Viewer: Built-in tool in VLSI software for visualizing and analyzing simulation 
  results.

  5.Synthesis Tools: Design Compiler, Vivado HLS for converting Verilog code to gate-level 
  implementation.

  6.Documentation Tools: Software for documenting design specifications, Verilog code, and 
  simulation outcomes.
